# Image-Encryption-Using-AES-And-Visual-Cryptography

This project is an implementation of the journal "**A Novel Image Encryption Algorithm using AES and Visual Cryptography**". 

Language used: Python 3.7.4 on Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)
Libraries used: base64, hashlib, Crypto.Cipher, Crypto.Random, numpy, cv2 and sklearn.linear_model

**Instructions to the code**
1. .zip file is to be unzipped.
2. Juypter Notebook is to be run and navigated to the folder from the zip file.
3. Run Encrpytion.ipynb file to convert an image from pics folder to cipher text.
4. mykey.txt in keys folder is used in encryption.
5. ToBeSent for Decryption folder stores the generated cipher text and key split images.
6. On running the Decryption.ipynb file we get our original image named as DecryptedImg.
Note: For another run some file names and folder names have been changed in the code.
